	<blockquote>Good morning. As detailed in yesterday's meeting, you will receive full access to the remains of the network through the link below.
		Our main interest is to obtain information that allows us to understand last week's events in as much detail as possible. The initial analyses conducted by our technicians did not yield results. The surface layer of the network is severely damaged. <br><br>
		Doctor Baruch continues in a state of catatonia, only occasionally interrupted to shout the phrase "IN TWO..." repeatedly. Additionally, he exhibits some form of hemiplegia, as the right half of his body is paralyzed and does not respond to any stimulus. The medical team has not yet been able to attribute a cause to his condition.
		As requested, security recordings were reviewed again. However, nothing new was found. The Doctor activates the system, shouts, scratches his face, and collapses. All within a few seconds. There is no one else in the room, and Baruch is not connected to the machine in any visibly observable way.
		The information we could gather from his collaborators is scarce, as they all abandoned the project in the months leading up to the incident. However, those who did not refuse to cooperate provided the following data that may be relevant:<br><br>
		• Baruch "conversed" with the machine frequently through its interface. Additionally, he kept a record of his internal emails and made "developer notes" as a log.<br>
		• Some of these elements may be relatively intact in central layers of the network.<br><br>
		Finding this data seems to be our best option. To favor this possibility, you will be given access to images taken directly from the physical notebook in which Karim Baruch made handwritten notes. It is possible that among these notes, there are keys to reaching more central regions of the machine's "mind."
		We ask that you communicate any progress urgently to our office.<br><br>
